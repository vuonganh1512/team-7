The Model files will be supllied by the user.

The model will be validated as correct format [CRN]

The model will be validated as correct format [SBML]

The model will be check for static / structural problems [Long Term Goal]

The model will be sent to the backend along with a set of parameters




-----------------------------------------------------

The user can specify the following parameters:

- Number of Simulations

- Max Molecule Count

- Max Reactions per simulation

- Which Species(variables) to track in the simulation

- Max Time of the simulation

- Max machine Time of the simulation

- Max Time of the test suite [Long Term Goal, requires calculating time for each simulation based on test suite]
